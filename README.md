# PyBer

# Overview of the analysis
  In our new data analysis for Pyber we wanted to find out disparities between fares by city type. Separating fares up by weeks, we were able to use our Pyber data to create a summary data frame and line chart to help explain how the type of city can affect the fares generated for rides.
# Results
  The differences in ride sharing data is about what you would expect. Weekly fare accumulations are higher where there are higher concentrations of people to take advantage of the PyBer service. In the summary dataframe we created below we can see the huge gaps between total rides and total drivers depending on the type of city you reside in.

  The results of that data has a subsequent effect on the average fares, which should be expected when we think about supply and demand. Average fares will be higher in cities where we have less PyBer drivers to provide the service. When we are in an Urban city with more drivers the average fare will be lower because there is more competition. Another factor to consider is distance to destination. If you're in an urban city it should expected that the distances for travel will likely be shorter than a more rural (spread out) city or even a suburban city where the drivers may be put in more situations where they have to drive their customers to the other side of town. That's not to say that would never happen in an urban city, just that the frequency by which it occurs should be expected to be lower.
  In our second visual aid we put together a line graph showing the total fares accumulated by city type. Again, the results are as expected. The urban total fares is much higher than the suburban and rural. The differences in the average fare becomes negligible when we are summing a total ride count that is so much higher than the others.

  Our line graph also organizes our timeline on the x axis for months. It's hard to say for sure from the data whether there is any correlation between the time of year/season and the usage of the PyBer ride service. We see some dips and peaks but nothing that stands out as an outlier or super significant. We would need a larger selection of data to make any sort of conclusions on that.
# Summary and Suggestions
  With this data we can make a few suggestions for future business changes. One of the main problems PyBer faces is the Urban:Rural disparity. The problem lies in that PyBer just doesn't have as many drivers for these rural and suburban areas, which is keeping the fares at a level that disincentivizes rider usage. One potential change would be providing financial incentives to attract potential drivers to these areas. If we can up the number of drivers in the PyBer fleet for the rural and suburban cities then fares should go down and provide a better service for our riders. Another idea is that PyBer could partner with local influential organizations, such as colleges, and work with the school to provide discounted rates to students and faculty. Again, if the fares go down then we should be able to get more people excited about using the service. Given our data, it could be assumed that we have a problem with our urban drivers operating in a saturated market, similarly to our first suggestion we could market directly to the urban city drivers the idea of going and driving for PyBer in rural and suburban citites. PyBer could lure them with the idea of less competition and higher fares per ride. PyBer could even offer to pay for a hotel room for a driver for two nights and say that the hotel will be paid in full as long as you are available to drive on our app for "x number of hours" during your stay. This could be seen as a fun escape for a driver and mini vacay, while also helping PyBer branch out into less served markets.
